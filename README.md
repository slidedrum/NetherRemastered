# Nether Remastered

A fabric 1.17.1 minecraft mod heavily based on End Remastered: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/endremastered-fabric

name WIP, Textures WIP, item/block names WIP, clode cleanup WIP, some mechanics WIP.  But you can craft all the blocks, find the lighter, build the portal, and go to the nether!  

 - Default obsidian portals are dissabled!  
 - To get to the nether, you need to go find 10 of 14 resources around the overworld.  Surround obsidian with 8 of the resource to create the obsidian version of it.  
 - Create a 4x6 portal frame as normal, made of at least 10 new *unique* obsidian blocks.  the rest of the blocks can be filled with normal obsidian, crying obsidian, or duplicates of the new blocks.  
 - The other side of the portal will be created out of a temp "obsidian portal" block that will drop a random obsidian resource block.  In a future update I plan to make it copy the makeup of the portal you created in the overworld and remove the obsidian portal block.  
 - You need a special lighter to light the portal, you can find it in ruined portal chests as a 100% chance.  I plan to create my own custom structure to obtain the lighter in a future update.  as well as make ruined portals use the new blocks.
 - The 14 resources are:
```
* Amethyst
* Coal
* Copper
* Deepslate
* Diamond
* Dripstone
* Emerald
* Gold
* Iron
* Lapis
* Lava buckets
* Mossy Cobblestone
* Redstone
* Water buckets
```
